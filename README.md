# 📊 Floorsheet Data Analysis using Python & Pandas
🔍 Project Overview
This project performs comprehensive transaction-level analysis of stock market floorsheet data to uncover trading patterns, broker behavior, market manipulation signals, and data-driven trading insights.
Using Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Scikit-learn, the project transforms raw floorsheet CSV files into actionable analytical outputs and signals.

🎯 Objectives

 -  Clean and preprocess large-scale floorsheet transaction data

-  Analyze broker dominance, accumulation/distribution phases, and trading concentration

 -  Detect abnormal and manipulative trading behaviors

-  Generate rolling, weighted, and expanding window indicators

 - Create signal scoring and backtesting frameworks

-  Provide market surveillance-style insights similar to exchange-level analysis
